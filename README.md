# ATMO : Sustainable Projects Registry

## Description

The **Sustainable Projects Registry** is a pioneering platform designed to bridge sustainable project development with blockchain technology. Registered with Verra, this platform empowers Project Developers to create and manage fractional NFTs representing their sustainable initiatives. These NFTs are minted on the Aptos blockchain, ensuring secure, transparent, and immutable records.

## Key Features

- **Project Registration:** Each sustainable project is officially registered with Verra, confirming its adherence to rigorous sustainability standards.

- **Fractional NFT Creation:** Project Developers can issue fractional NFTs that encapsulate the value of their projects. Minted on the Aptos blockchain, these NFTs benefit from enhanced security and scalability.

- **Marketplace Integration:** The platform includes an integrated marketplace where holders and end users can purchase fragments of these NFTs. This facilitates fractional ownership and enables broader investment in sustainable projects.

- **Verification Process:** All project submissions undergo a thorough verification process by a third-party assessor, ensuring that only credible and validated projects are represented through NFTs.

By merging sustainability with blockchain technology, the Sustainable Projects Registry fosters transparent and democratized investment in green projects, advancing both environmental and financial goals.
